# PY-SWITCH-CASE-BASIC

A simple Python program that demonstrates switch-case functionality using dictionary-based mappings and other alternatives, as Python lacks a native switch-case statement.

## Overview

This project provides a basic example of how to simulate switch-case behavior in Python, commonly used in languages like C++ and Java. It's ideal for beginners looking to understand alternative control flow structures in Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodewithTanzeel/PY-SWITCH-CASE-BASIC.git
   ```

2. Run the program:

   ```bash
   cd PY-SWITCH-CASE-BASIC
   python main.py
   ```

## Example

```python
def switch_example(option):
    cases = {
        1: "Option 1 selected",
        2: "Option 2 selected",
        3: "Option 3 selected"
    }
    return cases.get(option, "Invalid option")
```

This function uses dictionary mapping to mimic switch-case behavior.
